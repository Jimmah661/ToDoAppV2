## **ToDo App: Version 2**

### **Technologies Used:**
HTML  
Javascript  
CSS

### **Libraries used:**
None

### **Purpose of the project:**
Building off of my first version, I'm expanding upon it to add more functionality. As with the first version I'm strictly using plain HTML, Javascript and CSS in an effort to brush up on my basic skills. 

### **What this project does:**
Again communicating with a Firestore database to add, store and dynamically update ToDo notes, you can now also shift these notes around, adjusting their order and moving them between different containers. 

### **How to use the application:**
**Adding a ToDo**  
Enter your new ToDo text in the Input field  
When you are ready to store it click the Save Todo button below the input field

**Modifying a ToDo**  
By single clicking on a ToDo you can change the status between **Complete** and **Incomplete**  
Clicking and dragging a ToDo will allow you to reorder it in the list and shift it to a different Container

**Deleting a ToDo**  
This function is not yet available but will be worked into the next version using an archiving function
